# Cricket League Franchise System â€“ JavaFX + Networking Project

This is a JavaFX-based client-server application designed for a simulated **Cricket League**, where multiple franchise clients can connect to a central server to manage player trades, view profiles, and add new players. Built using **Java Socket Networking** and **JavaFX UI**, this project demonstrates real-time communication and basic user-role access control.

## Project Architecture

- **Server:** Manages all client requests, stores player data, and handles synchronization.
- **Client (Franchises):** Login-enabled clients that can buy and sell players.
- **Public Viewers:** Users without franchise login can still view player profiles and add new players.
